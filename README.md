| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Apply_image_restoration.ipynb`               | Demonstrates techniques to restore degraded images, including denoising and deblurring.                 |
| `background_subtraction.py`                   | Python script to detect moving objects in video streams using background subtraction methods.           |
| `canny_edge.ipynb`                            | Implements the Canny edge detection algorithm to highlight object boundaries.                           |
| `contours.ipynb`                              | Explores finding and drawing contours in images for shape analysis and object detection.                |
| `image_operation.ipynb`                       | Covers basic image operations such as resizing, cropping, flipping, and pixel-wise transformations.     |
| `various_image_segmentation_algorithms.ipynb` | Implements multiple image segmentation techniques like thresholding, k-means, and watershed algorithms. |
